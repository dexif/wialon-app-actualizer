<p>"Actualizer" is an application that allows you to detect "dead units", i.e., units that have not sent any data for a long period. Unit's activity is estimated according to the time of the last message received from it.</p>
<p>At launching, all available units are displayed in the order beginning form the most 'inactive' one. For your convenience, information about the last message is represented simultaneously in two forms: (1) date and time of the message and (2) how many days ago.</p>
<p>The list of units can be sorted by last message time as well as by name. Furthermore, filtration by days can be applied, i.e., you can get a list of units not sending data for N and more days.</p>
